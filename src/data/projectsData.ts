      'During my<strong > semester in Canada</strong>, in my second year of BUT, I had the opportunity to deepen my skills in InDesign by designing a <strong >36-page book</strong> about fashion and clothing. The book starts with an introduction to fashion before guiding the reader through <strong > five key chapters.</strong>',
    description2:
      'The first, <strong >The Basics of Personal Style</strong>, provides a global understanding of body shapes to help define oneâ€™s own style while avoiding common mistakes. Next comes <strong >Color Mixing Rules</strong>, a chapter dedicated to the fundamentals of color theory: learning how to mix colors, understanding their harmony, and mastering Pantone shades. The third chapter immerses the reader <strong > in the world of materials </strong>, from natural to synthetic, explaining how each one works and how it is used.',
    description3:
      'The book continues with a chapter on <strong >garment care</strong>: how to extend their lifespan, choose the right washing cycle, repair clothes, and prioritize quality over quantity. Finally, the book concludes with a crucial chapter: <strong >Ethical Fashion</strong>. It highlights the issues of <strong >fast fashion versus slow fashion</strong>, raising awareness of their impacts and emphasizing the importance of recycling and second-hand shopping. To this day, it remains the project I am most proud of.',
