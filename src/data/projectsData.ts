      'During my<strong > semester in Canada</strong>, in my second year of BUT, I had the opportunity to deepen my skills in InDesign by designing a <strong >36-page book</strong> about fashion and clothing. The book starts with an introduction to fashion before guiding the reader through <strong > five key chapters.</strong>',
    description2:
      'The first, <strong >The Basics of Personal Style</strong>, provides a global understanding of body shapes to help define one‚Äôs own style while avoiding common mistakes. Next comes <strong >Color Mixing Rules</strong>, a chapter dedicated to the fundamentals of color theory: learning how to mix colors, understanding their harmony, and mastering Pantone shades. The third chapter immerses the reader <strong > in the world of materials </strong>, from natural to synthetic, explaining how each one works and how it is used.',
    description3:
      'The book continues with a chapter on <strong >garment care</strong>: how to extend their lifespan, choose the right washing cycle, repair clothes, and prioritize quality over quantity. Finally, the book concludes with a crucial chapter: <strong >Ethical Fashion</strong>. It highlights the issues of <strong >fast fashion versus slow fashion</strong>, raising awareness of their impacts and emphasizing the importance of recycling and second-hand shopping. To this day, it remains the project I am most proud of.',

      'During my <strong>internship at I-Activ</strong>, an AI-focused company, I worked as the <strong>in-house designer</strong> alongside the director‚Äîmy brother‚Äîin a high-trust, high-standards setting. I led the brand‚Äôs <strong>visual identity</strong> end to end, from early research to deployment across print, motion, and web.',
    description2:
      'The logo reflects that direction: a simple mark read as both an <strong>hourglass</strong> (time saved) and an <strong>infinity symbol</strong> (boundless potential). Drawn with continuous curves and softened angles, it remains clear at small sizes and suits interface use. I delivered the vector master and clear-space rules, solid and gradient variants, a square app icon, and a <strong>volumetric version</strong> for hero visuals and mockups.',
    description3:
      'On the print side, I designed the <strong>business cards</strong> through several iterations. Early proposals were too demonstrative and effect-driven; feedback sessions with the team led to a <strong>more restrained version</strong> that foregrounds the symbol and clarifies the information hierarchy. The final result features precise layout, measured use of gradients, and <strong>immediate readability</strong> of contact details tailored for real-world use.',
    description4:
      'Beyond the deliverables, the project taught me to <strong>structure my process</strong> and to collaborate effectively with <strong>internal clients</strong>. I documented each decision, articulated visual trade-offs, and organized approvals to keep a fast iteration pace without losing the big picture. By the end of the internship, the identity was established, the key assets were produced, and the brand had a <strong>coherent, extensible system</strong> that is immediately recognizable on screen and in print.',

    description2:
      'In the public realm, the campaign appears through <strong>MUPI posters</strong>, flyers, and invitation cards. Each asset stages a character built from <strong>collage</strong> (historic head, contemporary clothing), a crown sketched in chalk as a nod to the princely heritage, and the <strong>yellow line</strong> that structures the information. Headlines highlight the slogan <strong>‚ÄúExplore the eras‚Äù</strong> and the new historical circuit to combine emotion, clarity, and a territorial call to action.',
    description3:
      'On the web, the <strong>landing page</strong> acts as the editorial entry point and surfaces key information: an <strong>interactive map</strong> of the spaces, an explanation of the new historical route, an events calendar, a <strong>countdown</strong> to opening, historical milestones, and highlights of the major transformations, together with an invitation to (re)discover Montb√©liard through the museum. The page embeds the <strong>animated signature</strong> to assert a strong identity from the first screen.',
    description4:
      'The campaign establishes an <strong>immediately recognizable</strong> art direction that extends the official guidelines while making them more expressive and accessible to the public. It builds momentum toward <strong>2028</strong>, structures the messaging around the museum‚Äôs transformation, and enables <strong>multi-channel</strong> distribution with a single <strong>visual grammar</strong>.',

      'This project, carried out during my semester in Canada, was our <strong>first opportunity to work with an external client </strong> outside of school.

      'The goal of the website is to resemble a <strong> museum</strong>: elements are placed in an apparently random yet structured way on the screen, mimicking an exhibition layout. The website‚Äôs background features the artist‚Äôs <strong>very first artistic style</strong>, dating back more than three years. Although he no longer practices this style, he <strong>remains deeply attached to it</strong> and appreciated the idea of incorporating a <strong>nod to his early works</strong> into his site.</p>',

      'As for the content, I structured the homepage around his <strong>current artistic styles</strong>. First, <strong>Mati√®re Vive</strong>, his most fully developed style, which he actively practices today and considers the core of his artistic journey. Next, <strong>Harmonie Chaotique</strong> represents an experimental phase‚Äîsomewhere between <strong>exploration and refinement</strong>‚Äîaiming to add complexity to his work. Finally, <stroke>Connexions</stroke>, far more abstract than the others, can be compared to the work of<strong> Piet Mondrian</strong>.',
